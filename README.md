## Build instructions

### Installing the Required Programs

First you need to install Haxe and HaxeFlixel. I'm too lazy to write and keep updated with that setup (which is pretty simple). 
1. [Install Haxe 4.1.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.1.5/) (Download 4.1.5 instead of 4.2.0 because 4.2.0 is broken and is not working with gits properly...)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) after downloading Haxe

Other installations you'd need is the additional libraries, a fully updated list will be in `Project.xml` in the project root. Currently, these are all of the things you need to install:
```
flixel
flixel-addons
flixel-ui
hscript
newgrounds
```
So for each of those type `haxelib install [library]` so shit like `haxelib install newgrounds`

You'll also need to install polymod. To do this, you need to do a few things first.
1. Download [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Works for Windows, Mac, and Linux, just select your build.
2. Follow instructions to install the application properly.
3. Run `haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git` in terminal/command-prompt after your git program is installed.

You should have everything ready for compiling the game! Follow the guide below to continue!

At the moment, you can optionally fix the transition bug in songs with zoomed out cameras.
- Run `haxelib git flixel-addons https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-addons` in the terminal/command-prompt.
and you should be good to go there.

Once you have all those installed, it's pretty easy to compile the game. You just need to run 'lime test html5 -debug' in the root of the project to build and run the HTML5 version. Running 'lime test html5 -final' will disable the debug window that may pop up when assets are missing.
